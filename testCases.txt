functions can Do
1. query for a specific hardware
2. query for a hardware by range
3. can specify multiple hardware constraints
4. can add a hardware, will fail if not specific enough
5. can query for a build according to the hardware constraints
5. can add a build

1. Query for a specific hardware

with exact values
    a battery
    a battery called DJIPhantom3
    a camera with exactly 1080 mp
    a frame with exactly 4 motors

with comparsion and connecting constraints
    a frame with exactly 4 motors and called TBSV5
    a frame with more than 3 motors and called TBSV5
    a battery called DJIPhantom4 with more than 5100 wh capacity and weights more than 630 g
    a battery with weight more than 0 grams and weights less than 0 grams
    a battery with weight more than 0 grams and weights more than 0 grams

    a camera with more than 0 p and more than 0 p and less than 100000 p
    a camera with more than 0 p and more than 0 p and less than 100000 p and called DJI
    a camera with more than 0 p and more than 0 p and less than 100000 p and called DJI and weights exactly 36 grams

Build
    a build with a battery called 6SLipo
    a build with a battery with weight more than 0 grams
    a build with a frame with weight more than 0 grams
    a build with a frame with weight more than 0 grams and a battery called 6SLipo
    a build with a frame with weight more than 0 grams and a battery called 6SLipo and a frame called BWhoop65

add a hardware
    add a battery with exactly 5100 wh capacity and weights more than 630 g and called  -> should fail
    add a frame called TestFrame with weight exactly 10 grams and exactly 4 motors -> do this twice to show primary key restrictions
    add a frame called TestFrameFail with weight exactly 10 grams and more than 4 motors -> case where the value is not fully specified
    add a frame called TestFrameFail2 with weight exactly 10 grams -> when some value is not specified

add a build

    -> you can specify a range for the hardware, the system will pick the first satisfied hardware
    create a build called myTestbuild1 with a battery called 1SLipo and a camera with weight less than 4 grams

    -> Will fail you the hardware specified does not exist
    create a build called myTestbuildFail1 with a motor called 1SLipo and a camera with weight less than 4 grams
    -> can try to fix the motor to make this success
    
    create a build called myCompleteBuild with a motor and a camera with more than 1080 mp and a frame with exactly 4 motors and a battery called 6SLipo and a control unit with more than 100 meters of transmission distance
